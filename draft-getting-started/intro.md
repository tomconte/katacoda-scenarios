# Draft: Streamlined Kubernetes Development

Draft makes it easier for developers to build applications that run on Kubernetes by doing two main things:

- The `draft create` command gives developers the artifacts they need to build and run their applications in Kubernetes
- The `draft up` command builds the container image for an application and deploys it to Kubernetes

Draft targets the "inner loop" of a developer's workflow: as they hack on code, but before code is committed to version control.

In this tutorial you will learn how to get started with Draft.
